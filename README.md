#Geotools

A simple library used to geocode an address, reverse geocode coordinates, and calculate the distance between two locations.

Google Maps API services are used for both geo and reverse geocoding. 

This is my first open-source contirubtion. Any and all feedback/suggestions is appreciated and should be sent to: [loganbestwick@gmail.com](mailto:loganbestwick@gmail.com)

<h2>To-Do:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Build tests</li>
	<li>Use AirBnB's JS Styling Guide</li>
	<li>Allow for API key to be used</li>
	<li>Stay consistent: all lon should be converted to lng</li>
	<li>Throw errors</li>
</ul>
